To fix:
I want to know who was the "Psycho" movie (1960) soundtrack composer. Then I want to listen full audio on youtube.

Homework:
I want to know who was the "Mad Max: Fury Road" movie (2015) soundtrack composer. Then I want to listen full audio on
Soundclound (~3:39min audio will be enough for me).
